- On this project I was mainly focusing on a backend side;
- Technologies that I have used were Spring Framework, Java, JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL;
- With the help of Spring Security u can Log in or get registrated;
- There are three types of role models (Admin, User and Moderator);
- Admin and Moderator can have an access to enter admin panel , where he can add an item, brand or category, whilist user don't have an access;



in order to log in as a admin use this account :  admin@mail.ru    password: ss ;
